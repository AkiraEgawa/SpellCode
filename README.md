## Notes
- Part for Akira (Probably popped up in mind and want to keep written before forget)
  - SpellRuntime will not create the fireballs and stuff, I want to broadcast a message to the player object and let the player object execute the spell with the given parameters.  This way feels cleaner
  - Tmr (12-23), implement a way to parse spells and test it by printing stack to console or smth, just make sure your math functions work. Also, implement a way to store multiple spells, thanks
